# docs

This is a directory containing the instructions to Sphinx (`pip install sphinx`)
for generating HTML-based source code documentation for the pyutils library.

You can generate the current docs via `make html`.  This expects a GNU make
utility.

The generated docs are hosted at  [https://github.com/scottgasch/pyutils/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/scottgasch/pyutils/tree/master/docs).

I regenerate (and publish) the docs as a .git/hook/post-push step.
