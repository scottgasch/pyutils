This is Scott's pyutils module.  See README.md for details.

Some code in this library came from other sources.  As required by
clause 4 of the Apache 2.0 License and clause 3 of the PSF License,
this NOTICE file describes changes Scott Gasch made to any preexisting
code regardless its original License.  All such original code was used
in a manner compliant with its original License and is enumerated in
this file.  This file also contains URLs pointing at the orginal
source of all forked code.

  1. As noted in string_utils.py, that file is a fork of work by
  Davide Zanotti.  Davide's original code is here:

  https://github.com/daveoncode/python-string-utils/tree/master/string_utils

  David's code was released under the MIT license and the original license
  text is preserved in string_utils.py.

  Scott's modifications include:
    + Added these routines: strip_escape_sequences,
      suffix_string_to_number, number_to_suffix_string, extract_ip_v4,
      extract_ip_v6, extract_mac_address, extract_ip, to_bool,
      to_date, valid_date, to_datetime, valid_datetime, squeeze,
      indent, dedent, sprintf, strip_ansi_sequences, SprintfStdout,
      capitalize_first_letter, it_they, is_are, pluralize,
      make_contractions, thify, ngrams, ngrams_presplit, bigrams,
      trigrams, shuffle_columns_into_list, shuffle_columns_into_dict,
      interpolate_using_dict, to_ascii, to_base64, is_base64, from_base64,
      chunk, to_bitstring, is_bitstring, from_bitstring, ip_v4_sort_key,
      path_ancestors_before_descendants_sort_key, replace_all, and
      replace_nth.
    + Added type annotations everywhere,
    + Wrote doctests everywhere,
    + Added sphinx style pydocs,
    + Wrote a supplimental unittest (tests/string_utils_test.py),
    + Added logging.

  2. As noted in shared_dict.py, that file is a fork of work by
  LuizaLabs and available here:

  https://github.com/luizalabs/shared-memory-dict/blob/main/shared_memory_dict/dict.py

  The original work was released under the MIT license and the original license
  text is preserved in shared_dict.py.

  Scott's modifications include:
    + Adding a unittest (tests/shared_dict_test.py),
    + Added type hints,
    + Changes to locking scope,
    + Minor cleanup and style tweaks,
    + Added sphinx style pydocs.

  3. The timeout decortator in decorator_utils.py is based on original
  work by Stephen "Zero" Chappell published in ActiveState code
  recipes and covered by the PSF license.  It is from here:

  https://code.activestate.com/recipes/307871-timing-out-function/

  The original PSF license text is included in the relevant section
  of decorator_utils.py.

  Scott's modifications include:
    + Adding docs + comments including a doctest unittest,
    + Minor cleanup and style tweaks,
    + Added type hints.

  4. The Easter calculation (function easter() in dateutilz.datetime_utils.py)
  was copied directly with from the dateutil (pip install python-dateutil)
  project in order to remove that dependency from this project.

  Dateutil is an Apache 2.0 licensed open source project.  The original
  copyright for that code is reproduced above the stolen function.

  Scott didn't do anything to this logic other than minor formatting changes.

Thank you to everyone who makes their code available for reuse by
others and contributes to the open source ecosystem.  Scott is
especially grateful to the authors of the projects above.  Thank you.
