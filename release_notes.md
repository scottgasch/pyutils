# 游꾸 Release notes (`0.0.1b3`)

## Changes
- Handle exception from os when attempting to determine console sizes.
- Fall back on os.get_terminal_size() rather than calls to tput/stty when we can't figure out how big the console is.
- More work to improve documentation generated by sphinx.  Also fixes some type hints that were confusing mypy and re-enables the doctests in collectionz/trie + collections/bst.  Some improvement of the typez/centcount and typez/money that were inspired by improving their docs.
- More work to improve the quality of sphinx autodocs.
- More writing examples and improving documentation.

- Improve documentation in argparse_utils.py.
- Improve documentation in ansi.py.
- Minor logic changes (e.g. thunk one method to another) but a lot of documentation cleanup.
