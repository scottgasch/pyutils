Stuff under here is example code that uses pyutils library routines and
is meant to just be illustrative and fun.  Each should be runnable as-is
if you have pyutils installed.  Use the --help flag for more info.

cron:
    Wrapper for running cronjobs with optional locks to ensure that no
    more than one instance executes at the same time, optional max
    frequencies, optionally touch a file on successful execution to
    drive monitoring, etc...

dedup_files:
    Util that traverses a directory structure and identifies files that
    are duplicates of each other then optionally deletes duplicates or
    symlinks duplicates back to an original.

parallelize_config:
    This is a sample config file (place in ~/.remote_worker_records or
    override with --remote_worker_records_file) for the @parallelize
    framework to understand how to dispatch work to remote machines.

pyskel:
    This is a "skeleton" I keep around for when I want to start
    working on a new script.

reminder:
    Reminds you of important dates which are stored in the .reminder
    file.

scrabble:
    Helps you play Scrabble word game.

wordle:
    Plays and helps you cheat at the Wordle word game.  Demo of using
    the @parallelize framework and shared_dict which it uses to
    precompute the solution space on several processes at once.
