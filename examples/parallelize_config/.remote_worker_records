# This file is a record of remote workers that
# @parallelize(method=Method.REMOTE) may send work to.  Each must have
# the same version of python installed and the cloudpickle package
# available, ideally in a virtual environment.  See setup instructions
# at: https://wannabe.guru.org/pydocs/pyutils/pyutils.parallelize.html.
#
# "username" must be able to ssh into each machine non-interactively
# (e.g. with a public/private trusted key, see ssh documentation).
#
# "weight" should be used to indicate the speed of a CPU on the target
# machine relative to other cpus in the pool.  It doesn't matter what
# number you pick but if one pool machine is roughly twice as fast as
# another its weight should be twice as high than the other's weight.
#
# Finally "count" should be used to indicate how many parallel jobs
# (max) to schedule on that machine.  This is usually the CPU count of
# the remote machine.
#
# The parallelize code looks for this file to be named
# .remote_worker_records and live in your $HOME directory but its
# name and path can be overridden via the --remote_worker_records_file
# commandline argument.
#
# This file is parsed by a JSON parser so spacing doesn't matter
# but proper bracing does.  A hacky(?) regular expression removes all
# comment lines (like this one) before parsing so beware of #'s where
# they shouldn't be.
