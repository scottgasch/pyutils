# This file is a record of remote workers that @parallelize(method=Method.REMOTE)
# may send work to.  Each must have the same version of python installed and the
# cloudpickle package available.  "username" (see below) must be able to ssh into
# each machine non-interactively (e.g. with a public/private trusted key, see ssh
# documentation).  "weight" should be used to indicate the speed of a CPU on the
# target machine and "count" should be used to indicate how many parallel jobs
# (max) to schedule on that machine.
