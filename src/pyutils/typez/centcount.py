"""An amount of money represented as an integral count of cents so as
to avoid floating point artifacts.  Multiplication and division are
performed using floating point arithmetic but the quotient is cast
back to an integer number thus truncating the result and
avoiding floating point arithmetic artifacts.  See details below.

The type guards against inadvertent aggregation of instances with
non-matching currencies, the division of one CentCount by another, and
has a strict mode which disallows comparison or aggregation with
non-CentCount operands (i.e. no comparison or aggregation with literal
numbers).

.. note::

    Multiplication and division are performed by converting the
    `CentCount` into a float and operating on two floating point
    numbers.  The result is then cast back to an int which loses
    precision beyond the 1-cent granularity in order to avoid floating
    point representation artifacts.

    This can cause "problems" such as the one illustrated
    below::

        >>> c = CentCount(100.00)
        >>> c
        100.00 USD
        >>> c = c * 2
        >>> c
        200.00 USD
        >>> c = c / 3
        >>> c
        66.66 USD

    Two-thirds of $100.00 is $66.66666... which might be
    expected to round upwards to $66.67 but it does not
    because the `int` cast truncates the result.  Be aware
    of this and decide whether it's suitable for your
    application.

See also the :class:`pyutils.typez.Money` class which uses Python
Decimals (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) to
represent monetary amounts.
