"""A decorator to help with dead simple parallelization.  See usage
below.

This will just work with `Method.THREAD` and `Method.PROCESS` but to
use `Method.REMOTE` you need to do some setup work.  You need to
configure a pool of workers.  Each worker should run the same version
of Python, ideally in identically configured virtual environments.
And you need to be able to ssh into each machine using key-based
authentication (i.e. non-iteractively) and run python.  List machines
in the location set by `--remote_worker_records_file` (see
:file:executors.h for flag and an example JSON file under examples).

    """This is a decorator that was created to make multi-threading,
    multi-processing and remote machine parallelism simple in python.

    Sample usage::

        @parallelize    # defaults to thread-mode
        def my_function(a, b, c) -> int:
            ...do some slow / expensive work, e.g., an http request

        @parallelize(method=Method.PROCESS)
        def my_other_function(d, e, f) -> str:
            ...do more really expensive work, e.g., a network read

        @parallelize(method=Method.REMOTE)
        def my_other_other_function(g, h) -> int:
            ...this work will be distributed to a remote machine pool

    This decorator will invoke the wrapped function on::

        Method.THREAD (default): a background thread
        Method.PROCESS: a background process
        Method.REMOTE: a process on a remote host

    The wrapped function returns immediately with a value that is
    wrapped in a :class:`SmartFuture`.  This value will block if it is
    either read directly (via a call to :meth:`_resolve`) or indirectly
    (by using the result in an expression, printing it, hashing it,
    passing it a function argument, etc...).  See comments on
    :class:`SmartFuture` for details.

    .. warning::
        You may stack @parallelized methods and it will "work".
        That said, having multiple layers of :code:`Method.PROCESS` or
        :code:`Method.REMOTE` will prove to be problematic because each process in
        the stack will use its own independent pool which may overload
        your machine with processes or your network with remote processes
        beyond the control mechanisms built into one instance of the pool.
        Be careful.

    .. note::
        There is non-trivial overhead of pickling code and
        copying it over the network when you use :code:`Method.REMOTE`.  There's
        a smaller but still considerable cost of creating a new process
        and passing code to/from it when you use :code:`Method.PROCESS`.
