"""
A :class:`Future` that can be treated as a substutute for the result
that it contains and will not block until it is used.  At that point,
if the underlying value is not yet available yet, it will block until
the internal result actually becomes available.

Results from :class:`parallelize.parallelize` are returned wrapped
in :class:`SmartFuture` instances.

Also contains some utilility code for waiting for one/many futures.
