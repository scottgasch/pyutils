"""This is the base class of
:class:`pyutils.parallelize.smart_future.SmartFuture`, which is a
piece of the simple parallelization framework.

This base class is essentially tries to have every Python `__dunder__`
method defined with a reasonabe default implementation so that, when
it is used in a manner that requires the value to be known, it calls
:meth:`DeferredOperand.resolve` and either gets the requisite value or
blocks until the data necessary to resolve the value is ready.  This
is meant to enable more transparent :class:`Future` objects that can
be just used directly.

See :class:`pyutils.parallelize.smart_future.SmartFuture` for more
information.
