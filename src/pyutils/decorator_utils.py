    .. note::

        the use_signals parameter is included in order to support
        multiprocessing scenarios (signal can only be used from the
        process' main thread).  When not using signals, timeout
        granularity will be rounded to the nearest 0.1s and will poll.

    .. warning::

        Beware that a @timeout on a function inside at the
        module-level will be evaluated at module load time and not
        when the wrapped function is invoked.  This is somewhat
        counterintuitive and tricky and it can lead to problems when
        relying on the automatic main thread detection code
        (`use_signals=None`, the default) since the import probably
        happens on the main thread and the invocation can happen on a
        different thread (one which can't use signals).  If in doubt,
        do not use the automatic signal safety logic and set their
        `use_signals` argument explicitly.

    Raises:

        An Exception with a timed out message when/if the timeout is
        reached.

    It is illegal to pass anything other than a function as the first
    parameter.  The function is wrapped and returned to the caller.
