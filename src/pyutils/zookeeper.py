This is a module for making it easier to deal with Zookeeper / Kazoo.
Apache Zookeeper (https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a consistent centralized
datastore.  :mod:`pyutils.config` optionally uses it to save/read program
configuration.  But it's also very useful for things like distributed
master election, locking, etc...

    """This is a hacky subclass of kazoo.recipe.lease.NonBlockingLease
    (see https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/recipe/lease.html#kazoo.recipe.lease.NonBlockingLease) that adds some behaviors:

        + Ability to renew the lease if it's already held without
          going through the effort of reobtaining the same lease
          name.

        + Ability to release the lease if it's held and not yet
          expired.

    It also is more picky than the base class in terms of when it
    evaluates to "True" (indicating that the lease is held); it will
    begin to evaluate to "False" as soon as the lease has expired even
    if you used to hold it.  This means client code should be aware
    that the lease can disappear (expire) while held and it also means
    that the performance of evaulating the lease (i.e. if lease:)
    requires a round trip to zookeeper every time.

    Note that it is not valid to release the lease more than once
    (since you no longer have it the second time).  The code ignores
    the 2nd..nth attempt.  It's also not possible to reobtain an
    expired or released lease by calling renew.  Go create a new lease
    object at that point.  Finally, note that when you renew the lease
    it will evaluate to False briefly as it is reobtained.
