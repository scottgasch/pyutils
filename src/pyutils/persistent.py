"""
This module defines a class hierarchy (base class :class:`Persistent`) and
a decorator (`@persistent_autoloaded_singleton`) that can be used to create
objects that load and save their state from some external storage location
automatically, optionally and conditionally.

A :class:`Persistent` is just a class with a :meth:`Persistent.load` and
:meth:`Persistent.save` method.   Various subclasses such as
:class:`JsonFileBasedPersistent` and :class:`PicklingFileBasedPersistent`
define these methods to, save data in a particular format.  The details
of where and whether to save are left to your code to decide by implementing
interface methods like :meth:`Persistent.get_filename` and
:meth:`Persistent.should_we_load_data`.

This module inculdes some helpers to make deciding whether to load persisted
state easier such as :meth:`was_file_written_today` and
:meth:`was_file_written_within_n_seconds`.

:class:`Persistent` classes are good for things backed by persisted
state that is loaded all or most of the time.  For example, the high
score list of a game, the configuration settings of a tool,
etc... Really anything that wants to save/load state from storage and
not bother with the plumbing to do so.
