    # bits of compressed info (25 bits, just over 3 bytes).  The last
    # (25th) bit in the steam happens to be a zero.  The compress code

    # complete the partial 4th byte.  In the 4th byte, however, one

    # a termination character and not regard it as a legitimate part
    # of the message.  This is a bug in that client code, to be clear.

    # However, it's a bug we can work around:
    #
    # Here, I'm appending an extra 0x00 byte to the compressed message
    # passed in.  If the client code dropped the last 0x00 byte (and,
    # with it, some of the legitimate message bits) by treating it as
    # a termination mark, this 0x00 will replace it (and the missing
    # message bits).  If the client code didn't drop the last 0x00 (or
    # if the compressed message didn't end in 0x00), adding an extra
    # 0x00 is a no op because the codepoint 0b00000 is a "stop" message
    # so we'll ignore the extras.
