"""This module contains two classes meant to help reduce unnecessary disk
I/O operations:

The first, :class:`DirectoryFileFilter`, determines when the contents
of a file held in memory are identical to the file copy already on
disk.

The second, :class:`DirectoryAllFilesFilter`, is basically the same
except for the caller need not indicate the name of the disk file
because it will check the memory file's signature against *all file
signatures* in a particular directory on disk.

See examples below.
