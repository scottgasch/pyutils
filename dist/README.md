# dist

This directory contains prebuilt, architecture independent [Python
wheels](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/) for pyutils releases.
If you don't want to or can't install pyutils via `pip install
pyutils` you can alternately download a wheel from here and use that
to install.  Pick a version (the latest version is marked on PyPi and
GitHub) then:

Fetch the wheel and its expected MD5.

    export VERSION=<whatever>
    wget "https://github.com/scottgasch/pyutils/raw/main/dist/pyutils-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl"
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottgasch/pyutils/main/dist/pyutils-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl.md5"

Check that the MD5 hash of the wheel file matches what's expected.
Expected MD5s are also available at PyPi -- find the version you
selected and make a URL like this example (by replacing 0.0.11):

    https://pypi.org/project/pyutils/0.0.11/#files.

Then click the 'view hashes' link and look at the MD5.  It should
match what is in the `*.whl.md5` file and what is generated by running
`md5` manually:

    md5 ./pyutils-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
    cat ./pyutils-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl.md5

If everything looks good, install the wheel directly via pip:

    pip install ./pyutils-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl
